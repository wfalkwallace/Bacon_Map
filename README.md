a java grapher for kevin bacon degrees using imdb data

####*NOTE:
This project is __abandoned__: IMDB text parsing was too much of a pain in the rump for a simple code-golf project.

This is under an MIT license, any pull requests are welcome; text processing could be cool, but more than I wanted to put in - we'll see if that changes after AI next term.

####TODO:
- text parsing, since imdb doesn't provide an api but _does_ give you poorly formatted textfiles listing all of its data. **LAME.**
- visual graphing; maybe jung or d3 or something.
