Bacon_Map
=========

a java grapher for kevin bacon degrees using imdb data

####*NOTE:
This project is __abandoned__: IMDB text parsing was too much of a pain in the rump for a simple code-golf project.

####TODO:
- text parsing, since imdb doesn't provide an api but _does_ give you poorly formatted textfiles listing all of its data. **LAME.**
- visual graphing; maybe jung or d3 or something.
